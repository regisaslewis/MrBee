# His name is Mr Bee!

A word game project by Regis Lewis

The Plan:

1) Figure out the gameplay mechanics of "Spelling Bee."
2) Establish a dictionary of accetable words.
3) Devise a way to select letters for the player to choose from.
    - One |necessary| letter and six |optional| letters.
4) Devise a scoring system and figure out a point goal.
5) Establish a CLI (Command Line Interface) for basic functionality - title card, player input, and exit.
6) Go further into implementing rules for the game:
    - minimum word length
    - required letter usage
    - words being found in dictionary
    - inclusion of PANGRAMS
7) Find bugs and figure out why (and fix).
